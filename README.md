## Conceptual Design

### ER-diagram for the Health and Fitness Club

The conceptual design of the database involves the creation of an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram for the Health and Fitness Club. The ER-diagram represents the relationships between entities within the database. Assumptions regarding cardinalities and participation types have been made to align with the problem statement outlined in Section 1.

### Assumptions

- [Specify assumptions made regarding cardinalities and participation types here.]

## Reduction to Relation Schemas

To implement the conceptual design, the ER-diagram is reduced to relation schemas. The following list outlines these schemas:

1. [List of relation schemas 1]
2. [List of relation schemas 2]
   .
   .
   .

## Normalization of Relation Schemas

Functional dependencies are established based on the problem statement and the design. The schemas are then normalized to ensure they meet a good normal form. The normalization process may include demonstrating the decomposition of schemas if necessary.

### Functional Dependencies

1. [Specify functional dependencies for relation schema 1]
2. [Specify functional dependencies for relation schema 2]
   .
   .
   .

### Normalization

[Discuss the normalization process and demonstrate how the schemas are in a good normal form or show their decomposition.]

## Database Schema Diagram

The final schema diagram for the Health and Fitness Club is presented below. It is designed to resemble the schema diagram of a university database, as covered in this course.

[Include the database schema diagram here.]
